# MemWar
A memory / pair matching game with special rules.

MemWar is a sample game created to test DNTeam framework. It can be compiled
on Linux, OSX, Android and iOS (probably on Windows too, although not tested).

The game features a reinterpretation of the classic pair matching game. Here,
some special matches could interact on the game if matched or missed. For
example, if you fail to match a bomb pair in some seconds, the boar will
explode and all pieces will be shuffled!
